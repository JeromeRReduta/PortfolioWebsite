Portfolio Website

This codebase represents my portfolio site, using the Spring Web framework and an embedded SQL
    database.

Currently hosted on [bit.ly/JRRedutaPortfolio](https://bit.ly/JRRedutaPortfolio).

To build it yourself, clone this repo and run it on any IDE. Alternatively, if you have
    Maven, you can clone this repo and run "mvn install." After running the built program,
    see the website on a browser at localhost:5000.
