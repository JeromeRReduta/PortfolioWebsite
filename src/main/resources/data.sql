    '	In college, I made a simple implementation of the “top” Linux command. While this is alright, I decided I could do better, and refactored everything over a week-long vacation. The architecture was rebuilt from the ground up, I made full use of header files, and I documented every single file with UML. I even made unit tests! It’s not the most impressive, but it’s something I accomplished in school that I’m proud of.'

    '	This is another college project I’m keeping for historical purposes. Throughout an intensive summer software development course, we had to create a search engine, refactoring constantly based on code review feedback. I added to and refactored starter files to make them process text, store them in an inverted index, crawl the web, output search results in JSON format, and then do all that using multiple threads in a work queue. This was one of the most educational projects I’ve done, and I’m proud to have it here.'

My favorite part is that every page describing each project (e.g. this page) is all dynamically built from the same template. That means I can add another page with 5 lines of Java and 1 new SQL statement.'
