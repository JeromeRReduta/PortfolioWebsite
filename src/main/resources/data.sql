The architecture was rebuilt from the ground up, I made full use of header files, and I documented every single file with UML. I even made unit tests! It’s not the most impressive, but it’s something I accomplished in school that I’m proud of.'

My favorite part is that every page describing each project (e.g. this page) is all dynamically built from the same template. That means I can add another page with 5 lines of Java and 1 new SQL statement.'
