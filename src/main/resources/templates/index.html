<p>Hi, I’m Jerome!</p>
<p>I’m a software developer from the Bay Area. I graduated from USF as a Computer Science-English double major. My dream
    is to craft simple, beautiful things.</p>
<p>I specialize in Java but am open to just about anything – web, full-stack, back-end, games, you name it and we’ll see
    where we can go from there.</p>
<p>Check me out through the navbar!</p>
